List of good involutions of nontrivial core quandles Core G for groups G of order 3
 
G = C3
X = [ <identity> of ..., f1, f1^2 ]
rho: 
<identity> of ... -> <identity> of ...
f1 -> f1
f1^2 -> f1^2

Rough upper bound on the number of good involutions of Core G: 1
Actual number of good involutions of Core C3: 1

Number of good involutions of core quandles of order 3: 1
